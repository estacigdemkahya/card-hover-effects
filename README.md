### code 365 challenge


The design was taken as an idea. Colorings and details have been changed to personal work. It was my 11th day workout for the Code 365 challenge. It is a work designed to be impressive for eye aesthetics on any site. It consists of cards and can be used on any website by making changes as desired.
